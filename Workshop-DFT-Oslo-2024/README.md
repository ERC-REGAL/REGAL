# Workshop on Quantum Theory: Foundations and Extensions of Density-Functional Theory
The presentation slides for several of the talks given at the *Workshop on Quantum Theory: Foundations and Extensions of Density-Functional Theory* in Oslo are avaliable in this folder. The workshop was held at the OsloMet campus Pilestredet, from the 2nd to the 6th of December 2024.
