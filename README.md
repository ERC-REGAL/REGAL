## Density-potential inversion from Moreau-Yosida regularization

+ [*Density-potential inversion from Moreau-Yosidda regularization*](https://doi.org/10.1088/2516-1075/acc626) (2023) in Electronic Structure. Also avaliable on [arXiv:2212.12727](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12727).
+ [Python 3.7 script](https://github.com/ERC-REGAL/REGAL/tree/main/MY-ZMP) based on a script for many-particle systems in Slater basis on graphs: fermion-graph

   This script is part of the public domain CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)

   Author: Markus Penz (2022)

   Main script is dens-pot-inversion.py includes the packages fermion_hamiltonian.py, graph_dft.py and timer.py

## Workshop on Density-Functional Theory in Oslo 2024
The presentation slides for several of the talks given at the *Workshop on Quantum Theory: Foundations and Extensions of Density-Functional Theory* in Oslo are avaliable in [this folder](https://github.com/ERC-REGAL/REGAL/tree/main/Workshop-DFT-Oslo-2024). The workshop was held at the OsloMet campus Pilestredet, from the 2nd to the 6th of December 2024. See the [workshop webpage](https://uni.oslomet.no/quantum/workshop-foundations-and-extensions-of-dft/) for further detials.
