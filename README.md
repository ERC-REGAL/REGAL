## Density-potential inv. from MY reg.

+ [Preprint: *Density-potential inversion from Moreau-Yosidda regularization*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12727)

+ Python 3.7 script based on a script for many-particle systems in Slater basis on graphs: fermion-graph

This script is part of the public domain CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)

Author: Markus Penz (2022)

Main script is dens-pot-inversion.py includes the packages fermion_hamiltonian.py, graph_dft.py and timer.py
